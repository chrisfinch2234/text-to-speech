NeoSpeech is a worldwide leader in the text-to-speech (TTS) industry. NeoSpeech was founded over a decade ago by two PhD speech engineers who were dissatisfied by how poor the quality was in speech synthesizers. Seeing no other alternatives, they created NeoSpeech, a TTS provider which provides natural sounding voices that rival human speech.


NeoSpeech is located in Santa Clara, California with more than 1,000 enterprise customers, spanning over a wide variety of industries including but not limited to broadcasting, announcement systems, and telecommunications.


Our team is held together through a passion within the text-to-speech industry and always making sure that we maintain the highest quality voices for our customers. Yearly we are improving our language selection at a fast pace without sacrificing performance or sound quality.
