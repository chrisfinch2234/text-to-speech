#About NeoSpeech

NeoSpeech is a worldwide leader in the text-to-speech (TTS) industry. NeoSpeech was founded over a decade ago by two PhD speech engineers who were dissatisfied by how poor the quality was in speech synthesizers. Seeing no other alternatives, they created NeoSpeech, a TTS provider which provides natural sounding voices that rival human speech.


NeoSpeech is located in Santa Clara, California with more than 1,000 enterprise customers, spanning over a wide variety of industries including but not limited to broadcasting, announcement systems, and telecommunications.


Our team is held together through a passion within the text-to-speech industry and always making sure that we maintain the highest quality voices for our customers. Yearly we are improving our language selection at a fast pace without sacrificing performance or sound quality.

#What we do as a TTS Provider:

We provide TTS solutions that enable developers to build custom speech-enabled products. Our versatile SDKs make it easy to build anything from a screen reading app to an IVR call center solution.


We also offer a cloud-based TTS solution called Web Service. Web Service is a SOAP and REST capable TTS solution that allows developers to build applications and websites that can connect to our online server. Once connected, our server will convert all TTS requests from your end-users and send back the audio files instantly.

#What our API does and how it works

Our API allows you to connect to our online server and take full advantage of our Web Service solution.

Our API is only accessible through our website. When you sign-up for our Web Service you will be able to request sentences from whichever programing language you are using. Both JAVA and XML are among favorites and you will simply create a sentence and from there you will wait until our server sends back a link in which you can copy and paste it into your browser and save onto your computer for immediate use.
